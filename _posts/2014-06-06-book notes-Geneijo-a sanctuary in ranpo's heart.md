Talking about Japanese detective novels, there always has an author we can not inevitable to mention. Tarou Hirai(平井太郎), better known by the pseudonym "Edogawa Ranpo(江户川乱步)".

Those who ever watched a cartoon named "Detective Conan" must have a familiar feeling about this name. In the first episode of this cartoon, when Mouri Ran asked about Kudou Shinichi's name(Kudou Shinichi already became an elementary student because of the APTX-4869), Shinichi was lost his tongue at first and moved slowly toward a bookshelf nearby. Then he noticed two books on that bookshelf, one was "Adventure of Sherlock Holmes" written by Arthur Conan Doyle and another was the novels collection of Edogawa Ranpo. There was a flash of thought in Shinichi's brain, "My name is Edogawa Conan." he said. That's the name accompanies me with my whole childhood. Of course, it isn't the only place where mentions "Edogawa Ranpo", the prototype of "Mouri Kogorou", who is a half-bucket detective usually targeted by Conan's anesthetic needle, is a famous character named "Akechi Kogorou". Akechi Kogorou is created by Ranpo, and also is the first detective role in the history of Japaneses detective literature. In addition, the prototype of "Junior Detective League" and "Kaitou Kiddo" in cartoon "Detective Conan" are all from Ranpo's novels.

The reason why Tarou Hirai used "Edogawa Ranpo" as his pseudonym is that he loved reading detective novel when he was in young age, especially the novel written by Edgar Allan Poe, who is an American author and an originator of detective literature, Tarou Hirai picked those letters which pronunciates close to "Edgar Allan Poe" in Japanese Gojouon to make his pen name.

Having came through boom and bust in his life, Ranpo entitled his own house as "Geneijou", which means illusive castle, when he reached his middle age. To Ranpo, this "castle" is a sanctuary in his heart. Before that, Ranpo had awarded many honors, from the maiden work "二銭銅貨" published in 1923 to "続・幻影城" published in 1963, his works in 40 years laid the foundation for Japanese detective literature, either "Honkaku" sect or "Henkaku" sect are all from Ranpo. Ranpo is an originator of Japanese detective literature and a spiritual leader with fully deserved. Feeling lonely and enjoying dreaming, Ranpo found a place from the gloomy world to rest and turned himself to the king of his illusive castle.

Ranpo often write down his motto to his fans, which is "浮世为梦，夜梦方为真实". Ranpo believed that the night dream is far more warm and soft then the cold and merciless living world. It was the night dream that made Ranpo create more and more classic works which fulls of ingenious and magical ideas. Ranpo also makes fun of himself to say that he usually thinking about many ways to kill people without  detected by police, and designing a slew of plans to make a perfect murder. No doubt that people will be frightend after hearing such an abnormal saying.
